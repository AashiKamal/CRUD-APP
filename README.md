# CRUD-APP
CRUD App with Node.js and MySQL
This repository contains a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built using Node.js and MySQL. The app allows you to perform basic CRUD operations on a database using a web interface.

Overview
The CRUD app provides the following functionality:

Create: Add new records to the database.
Read: Retrieve and view records from the database.
Update: Modify existing records in the database.
Delete: Remove records from the database.
Prerequisites
Before running the application, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

Node.js: Install Node.js from the official website (https://nodejs.org).
MySQL: Set up MySQL on your machine and configure the necessary database.
Setup and Installation
To set up and run the CRUD app, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies using a package manager like npm.
Configure the database connection by updating the configuration file with your MySQL credentials.
Create the necessary database tables by running the provided SQL script.
Start the application using the provided command.
Access the CRUD app in your web browser at the specified URL.
Usage
Once the application is running, you can use the CRUD app to perform the following actions:

Create: Add new records to the database by filling out a form.
Read: View the existing records from the database in a tabular format.
Update: Edit the information of existing records by selecting them and updating the values.
Delete: Remove records from the database by selecting them and confirming the deletion.
Security Considerations
When deploying the CRUD app to a production environment, consider the following security measures:

Secure database access: Ensure that your MySQL credentials are stored securely and not exposed.
Validate user input: Implement input validation and sanitization to prevent common security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection.
Implement authentication and authorization: If required, add authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect sensitive operations.
